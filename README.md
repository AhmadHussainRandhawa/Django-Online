# Services - Django Web Application

## Introduction
Welcome to **Services**, a Django-based web application that allows users to browse and manage services, reviews, and certificates with ease. This project was built as part of my Django learning journey, combining models, views, templates, and Tailwind CSS for a functional and polished application.
